# Spotify_Revenue_Predictor
This is an Machine learning project which uses Random Forest ML algorithm to predict the revenue generated for a given set of streams (with details such as country of origin, etc. given) at a resonable accuracy.
Keep in mind to give the names of countries exactly as stated in the training dataset, and only entries whose country names are present in the training dataset can be processed and predicted by the program.
The test data should be added to the test dataset excel file in the format mentioned in it. The column names should not change as they are used as key values, so they have to strictly remain the same.
