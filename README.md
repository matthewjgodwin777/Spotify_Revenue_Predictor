# Spotify_Revenue_Predictor
This is an Machine learning project which uses Random Forest ML algorithm to predict the revenue generated for a given set of streams (with details such as country of origin, etc. given) at a resonable accuracy.
Keep in mind to give the names of countries exactly as stated in the training dataset, and only countries whose names are present there can be processed by the program.
